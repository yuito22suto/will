# will
A message addressed to any one person

## Format Rule
- Do not write a vague, one-person narrative about your life up to that point.
 - Do not write vaguely to the people who helped you during your lifetime or to an unspecified number of people, but address your message to one person.
 - Set a time limit for writing. Do not write a vague, one-person narrative about your life up to that point.
 - Assume that the will will be valid for about one year, and do not think of writing a definitive version, thinking that you will write a new version next year.
